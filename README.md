# Satellite Pose Estimation

This project contains the Machine Learning written for my master's thesis for training the machine learning model described in the paper. The code contains the architecture for a neural network that I used for training, as well as scripts for loading the dataset, applying transformations, and handling the ground truth data effectively.

A Dockerfile with dependencies is added for convenience.

## Dataset Manipulation

This directory contains tools to manipulate the dataset and understand the dataset size, ensure that each image has a corresponding pose associated with it.

## Pose Estimation

Scripts that contain the neural network architecture definition, and scripts for training and performing pose estimation on the resulting images.
